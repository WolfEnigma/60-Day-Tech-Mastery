# Day 11 — Git & GitHub Professional Workflow  
**Track:** Linux → Cybersecurity → Cloud

---

## 1. Overview

Day 11 focused on **practical Git and GitHub usage as used in real engineering teams**.  
The goal was to move beyond basic commands and understand how version control supports **collaboration, security, auditability, and professional software delivery**.

This day connects directly to previous Linux work and prepares for upcoming cybersecurity and cloud projects where **clean version control is mandatory**.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Understand how Git tracks changes locally
- Use GitHub as a professional proof-of-work platform
- Practice clean commits, branching, and merging
- Learn workflows used in team-based engineering environments
- Build verifiable portfolio evidence using Git

---

## 3. Environment

- **Host OS:** Windows  
- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox  
- **Guest OS:** Kali Linux  
- **Shell:** Bash  
- **Remote Platform:** GitHub  

---

## 4. What I Learned

- How Git manages project history using commits
- The difference between local repositories and remote repositories
- Why feature branches are used instead of working directly on `main`
- How clean commit messages improve traceability
- How GitHub acts as both a collaboration tool and a professional portfolio

---

## 5. Practical Tasks Completed

- Initialized a Git repository using `git init`
- Configured global Git identity (name and email)
- Created and committed project files using `git add` and `git commit`
- Connected a local repository to GitHub using `git remote`
- Created, merged, and deleted a feature branch
- Inspected commit history using `git log`

---

## 6. Project

### Project Name: Git Professional Workflow Practice

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate correct Git usage including commits, branching, merging, and synchronization with GitHub.

**Outcome:**  
A clean, structured repository with documented commits and verifiable history suitable for technical review.

---

## 7. Security Perspective (Attacker & Defender)

**Attacker Perspective:**
- Poor version control hygiene can expose sensitive files
- Public repositories may leak credentials if not managed correctly
- Lack of commit history reduces accountability

**Defender Perspective:**
- Git provides an audit trail of changes
- Branching reduces risk to production code
- Controlled access to repositories limits exposure

---

## 8. Cloud Mapping

Git workflows directly map to cloud and DevOps practices:

- Feature branches → isolated development environments
- Merges → deployment pipelines
- Commit history → change tracking in cloud systems
- GitHub → CI/CD and infrastructure automation trigger point

---

## 9. Certification Progress

- **Git & GitHub (Hands-on Practice)**
  - Platform: GitHub
  - Status: Practical workflow completed
  - Evidence: Public repository with commit history

---

## 10. Evidence

The following files provide proof of work:

- `README.md` — Project documentation
- `network_notes.md` — Sample tracked file
- `answers.md` — Conceptual understanding
- Git commit history (verifiable on GitHub)

---

## 11. Skills Gained

- Git version control fundamentals
- Professional commit practices
- Branching and merging workflows
- Repository structuring for portfolios
- Secure and auditable code management

---

## 12. Status

- **Day 11:** Completed  
- **Next:** Day 12 — Ports, Services & Network Scanning (Nmap)
